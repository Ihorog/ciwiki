# Repository Status and Policies

## Active Repositories

Repositories where Copilot instructions and development workflows are active:
- `ciwiki` (canonical documentation)
- `cit` (CIT Family Assistant runtime)
- `cimeika-unified` (unified platform)
- `citt` (tooling)
- `media` (restricted: documentation only, no workflows/scripts)

## Frozen Repositories

### cit_versel

**Status:** Strictly frozen

**Policy:**
- No code changes
- No deployment actions
- No workflow modifications
- No pull requests
- No Copilot agent actions

**Rationale:** Repository is in maintenance-only mode. All active development has moved to other repositories in the Cimeika ecosystem.

**Contact:** For questions about `cit_versel` status, refer to the owner (Ihorog).
